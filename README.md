- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zconn or Zack Connaughton an experienced aerospace engineer developing skill in computer programming while building applications specifically targeted to engineeering at my work.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web development and data analytics/data science as these have a direct application to my current work. I'm developing the data collection and data cleansing processes and software required to streamline design engineering work and integrate with production of parts more efficiently and meaningfully.
