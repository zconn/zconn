- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @zconn or Zack Connaughton an experienced aerospace engineer with skill in computer programming, building applications specifically targeted to design engineering and project management work.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in expanding my front end experience as I have mostly been working back end and with our Arango database instance. I enjoy data analytics/data science as these have a direct application to my current work but still in the process of developing a good data pipeline for entry so I know the data coming in is clean enough for effective data science.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React but have experience in Angular and nest. I have also done smaller python projects in my certificate course and for my own personal learning.
